# @proj-airi/electron-window-dock

Dock Mode for the AIRI Electron app. It keeps an AIRI overlay window on a target window that the user selects.

## What it does

- Polls the bounds and the z-order of the target window in the Electron main process.
- Moves a transparent overlay window onto the target, or onto a rect inside the target.
- Hides the overlay when the target is hidden, minimized, fullscreen, or not frontmost.
- Creates the overlay window on the first start of a session, and destroys it when the session ends.
- Gives Eventa contracts (`windowDock`) to list the targets, start, stop, read the debug state, and set the config.

It moves only the AIRI overlay. It does not move or reparent the windows of other apps.

### Platforms

| Platform | Tracker | Windows that the tracker sees |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `@proj-airi/native-window-win32` | All top-level windows, with z-order and owner PID. If the binding does not load, the tracker uses the Electron-only fallback. |
| macOS | Electron-only fallback | Only the windows of AIRI. On macOS, Dock Mode can dock only to an AIRI window. |
| Linux | None | No windows. The target list is empty. |

See [`docs/dock-mode.md`](../../docs/dock-mode.md) for the visibility rules of each tracker.

## How to use

In the main process, call `setupWindowDock` one time. Give it a function that creates the overlay window.

```ts
import { setupWindowDock } from '@proj-airi/electron-window-dock/main'

const windowDock = setupWindowDock({
  // Return a hidden, transparent, not focusable window. Load its page before you return it.
  // When `signal` aborts, destroy the window.
  createOverlayWindow: async signal => createOverlayWindow(signal),
})

// On app quit, end the session and remove the IPC handlers.
app.on('before-quit', () => windowDock.dispose())
```

In a renderer, call the `windowDock` contracts through the shared Eventa context.

```ts
import { useElectronEventaInvoke } from '@proj-airi/electron-vueuse'
import { windowDock } from '@proj-airi/electron-window-dock'

const listTargets = useElectronEventaInvoke(windowDock.listTargets)
const startDock = useElectronEventaInvoke(windowDock.start)
const stopDock = useElectronEventaInvoke(windowDock.stop)

const [target] = await listTargets()
await startDock({ targetId: target.id })
await stopDock()
```

In AIRI, `apps/stage-tamagotchi/src/main/windows/dock-overlay/` gives the overlay window. The devtools page `/devtools/window-dock` is the UI.

## API

### `@proj-airi/electron-window-dock/main`

| Export | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `setupWindowDock(options)` | Creates the dock controller and registers the `windowDock` invoke handlers. Returns a `WindowDock`. |
| `WindowDockOptions.createOverlayWindow` | `(signal: AbortSignal) => Promise<BrowserWindow>`. Dock Mode calls it on the first start of a session. After 30 s, Dock Mode aborts `signal`. |
| `WindowDock.dispose()` | Removes the handlers, ends the session, and destroys the overlay window. |

The handlers use an Eventa context without a window. Any renderer can call them, and the reply goes to the caller.

### `@proj-airi/electron-window-dock`

| Contract | Request | Response |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `windowDock.listTargets` | None | `WindowTargetSummary[]`. The overlay window is not in the list. |
| `windowDock.start` | `{ targetId }` | `DockDebugState`. Starts a session, or changes the target of the current session. |
| `windowDock.stop` | None | `DockDebugState`. Ends the session and destroys the overlay window. |
| `windowDock.getDebugState` | None | `DockDebugState` |
| `windowDock.setConfig` | `DockConfig`, any subset of the fields | `DockDebugState`. Rejects an update with a value outside the limits. |

The entry also exports `defaultDockConfig` and the types `DockConfig`, `DockViewport`, `DockDebugState`, `DockModeState`, and `WindowTargetSummary`.

### Config

The main process validates each update with Valibot. An invalid update throws, and the current config stays.

| Field | Default | Limits | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `activeIntervalMs` | `80` | 16 to 60000 | The poll interval while the overlay is visible. |
| `hiddenIntervalMs` | `1000` | 100 to 60000 | The poll interval while the target is hidden, fullscreen, or not frontmost. |
| `burstIntervalMs` | `40` | 16 to 60000 | The poll interval after the overlay shows or the target moves. |
| `burstTicks` | `3` | Integer, 0 to 100 | The number of ticks at `burstIntervalMs`. |
| `clickThrough` | `true` | | If `true`, mouse events go through the overlay. |
| `padding` | `0` | 0 to 500 DIP | The space added on each side of the viewport rect. |
| `hideWhenNotFrontmost` | `true` | | If `true`, the overlay hides while a window is above the target. A hidden, minimized, or fullscreen target hides the overlay with either value. |
| `viewport` | `{ left: 0, right: 1, top: 0, bottom: 1 }` | Each edge 0 to 1, `left < right`, `top < bottom` | A rect inside the target, as fractions of the target size. |

### Sessions and states

| Event | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `start` without a session | Creates the overlay window, sets the target, and runs the first tick at once. |
| `start` during a session | Changes the target. The overlay window stays. |
| `start` during the overlay creation | Uses the same creation. The last `start` sets the target. |
| The overlay creation fails | `start` rejects with the error. The session ends in `detached` with the reason `overlay-failed`. |
| The overlay creation takes longer than 30 s | Aborts `signal`, and `start` rejects. The session ends in `detached` with the reason `overlay-failed`. A window that arrives later is destroyed. |
| `stop` | Ends the session in `detached`. Polling stops, and the overlay window is destroyed. A window that arrives later is destroyed, unless a new `start` uses it. |
| The tracker does not find the target | Ends the session in `companion` with the reason `target-missing`. |
| Code outside Dock Mode destroys the overlay window | The next tick ends the session in `detached` with the reason `overlay-destroyed`. |
| `dispose` | Ends the session. After this, `start` does nothing. |

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `detached` | No session. Dock Mode never started, a caller stopped it, or the overlay window failed or was destroyed. |
| `companion` | The target is hidden or minimized, and the session continues. A lost target also ends the session in this state. |
| `docking-attached-visible` | The overlay is on the target. |
| `docking-attached-hidden` | The target is fullscreen or not frontmost. The overlay is hidden. |

## When to use

- On Windows, use it in the AIRI Electron app to show AIRI on top of one window of another app. This is the intended use. It is not verified on Windows.
- Use it on macOS to show AIRI on top of another AIRI window.

## When not to use

- Do not use it on macOS to follow the windows of other apps. The macOS tracker sees only the windows of AIRI.
- Do not use it on Linux. The tracker finds no windows there.
- Do not import `./main` in a renderer. Renderers use only the contracts of the root entry.
- Do not use it to move, resize, or reparent the windows of other apps.

## Not verified on Windows

The tests use a fake tracker. Nobody ran this version on Windows. These parts are not verified on Windows:

- The Win32 tracker filters the windows of this process from the windows above the target.
- The Win32 tracker reports no windows above a foreground target, so that target counts as frontmost.
- The target list drops windows of this process that have the overlay title.
- The fullscreen check accepts a difference of 6 DIP between the target bounds and the display bounds.
- `screen.screenToDipRect` converts the rects of the binding to DIP.
- Click-through with `setIgnoreMouseEvents(true, { forward: true })` on the overlay window.
