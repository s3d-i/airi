# Crowdin batch review for AIRI

This skill reviews the translations that wait for approval on the AIRI Crowdin project. An agent judges each translation. A person applies the result with their own token.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24 or later, and `pnpm install` in this repository. The check script imports the placeholder rule from `.github/scripts/check-locales.ts`.
- A Crowdin personal access token with proofreader or manager access to the AIRI project. Create it in Crowdin: Account Settings > API > Personal Access Tokens.
- The project id defaults to `816610`, the id in `crowdin.yml` of `moeru-ai/airi`. To use another project, set `CROWDIN_PROJECT_ID`.

## Token rules

- The person sets the token in their own terminal. The agent never asks for, reads, prints, or passes the token.
- Set the token for the current terminal only. Do not write it into a shell profile.

```bash
read -rs "CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN?Crowdin token: " && export CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN
```

The command above is for zsh. In bash, use `read -rsp "Crowdin token: " CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN && export CROWDIN_PERSONAL_TOKEN`.

## Workflow

The scripts read and write their files in the current directory. Run them from a work directory outside the repository, so the review files stay out of Git. `<repo>` is the root of this repository.

1. **Check (person runs).** This step is read-only.

   ```bash
   node <repo>/.agents/skills/enforce-rules-for-i18n/scripts/pending-review.mjs
   ```

   It prints a table for each language. It writes `crowdin-pending-review.json` with all pending translations. It writes `crowdin-pending-review.md` with the flagged ones only: placeholder mismatch, same as English, and bad whitespace.

   If the table shows 0 pending, there is nothing to review. Go to step 5.

2. **Review (agent).** Read `crowdin-pending-review.json` and judge every entry with the policy below. Write `crowdin-review-decisions.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "approve": [{ "languageId": "es-ES", "file": "stage.yaml", "key": "a.b", "text": "..." }],
     "reject": [{ "languageId": "es-ES", "file": "stage.yaml", "key": "a.b", "text": "...", "reason": "..." }]
   }
   ```

   Generate this file from the JSON with a script. Do not type `file`, `key`, or `text` by hand. The apply script matches the exact text.

3. **Dry run (person runs).**

   ```bash
   node <repo>/.agents/skills/enforce-rules-for-i18n/scripts/apply-review.mjs
   ```

   The output must end with `All matched.` If one entry does not match, the script stops and changes nothing.

4. **Apply (person runs).**

   ```bash
   node <repo>/.agents/skills/enforce-rules-for-i18n/scripts/apply-review.mjs --approve --delete-rejected
   ```

   Before it deletes, the script writes a backup to `crowdin-rejected-backup-<timestamp>.json`.

   Then run step 1 again. A deleted translation can uncover an older suggestion for the same string. Review the new entries until pending is 0.

5. **Sync.** The `crowdin-cron-sync.yml` workflow exports approved translations once a day. To sync now, run it manually from GitHub Actions. It updates the `chore(i18n): update translations` pull request.

## Review policy

Reject a translation when:

- It is the same as the English text, even when the word is correct in that language, for example `OK`, `Error`, or a brand name. AIRI shows the English text for a string without a translation. Crowdin does not import a translation that is the same as the source.
- It has the wrong meaning or the wrong part of speech, for example a noun label translated as a verb phrase.
- Its placeholders differ from the English text: `{name}`, `{0}`, or `@:key`.
- It contains a literal `\n` where the English text has a line break.

Approve a translation when its meaning is correct, even if it has small style problems. List those problems in the report, so a translator can fix them on Crowdin. Do not reject a translation only for style.

Compare terms with the existing translations in `packages/i18n/src/locales/<locale>/`. Some Crowdin language ids differ from the folder names:

| Crowdin | Folder |
| --- | --- |
| `es-ES` | `es` |
| `zh-CN` | `zh-Hans` |
| `zh-TW` | `zh-Hant` |

Language notes:

- Spanish uses "tú", not "usted". Spanish titles use sentence case.

The report to the person has three parts: the counts, a table of rejected translations with the reasons, and a short list of approved translations that have style problems.

## Warnings in the sync pull request

- "Same translation as <other key>, whose English has no word in common" is a heuristic. It checks only strings that changed against `main`. After the pull request merges, the warning does not come back. Do not add an allowlist.
- Synonyms cause false positives, for example "Settings" and "Configuration". If the older key on `main` has the wrong translation, fix that key on Crowdin.
- New quotes around a translation come from Crowdin. When the English source string has quotes, for example `error: 'Error:'`, Crowdin adds quotes to the translation too. The value does not change.

## Fixing one approved translation

The batch scripts handle pending translations only. When an approved translation is wrong, write a small script for that string:

1. Find the string by its file and key.
2. Without `--apply`, print all translations of the string in that language and their approval state.
3. With `--apply`, write a backup, add and approve the correct text, and delete the other translations of the string in that language.
